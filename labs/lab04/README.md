# Lab 04

This lab provides you with the opportunity to practice creating, configuring, and utilizing a CDN via CloudFront.

**NOTE: When naming resources, include your initials in the names used (to ensure no name collision with other LAUNCH attendees)**

Execute the tutorial at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GettingStarted.SimpleDistribution.html. For this lab, you will be using the AWS Management Console with the username/password provided to you by the instructor.

Once you complete the steps, experiment with adding new content and updating existing content in your S3 bucket to explore how CloudFront manages access to your resources and caching.

Clean up your resources when done with the lab.
