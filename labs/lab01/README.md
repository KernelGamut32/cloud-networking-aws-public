# Lab 01

This lab provides you with the opportunity to practice creating and configuring a VPC & subnets in which you can run an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI.

**NOTE: When naming resources, include your initials in the names used (to ensure no name collision with other LAUNCH attendees)**

Execute the tutorial at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-subnets-commands-example.html. You can either leverage the AWS CLI which comes installed in the Cloud9 environment you set up or you can install and run the AWS CLI locally. If running locally, you will need to ensure your AWS credentials have been set correctly in your profile.

Clean up your resources (including the EC2 instance) when done with the lab.
